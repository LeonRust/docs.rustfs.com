## Global Object Storage Architecture Schools

Currently, distributed object storage products worldwide are mainly divided into two schools:

1. With metadata center: Ceph is the representative;

2. Without metadata center: RustFS and MinIO are representative products.

Comparison of advantages and disadvantages between having and not having a metadata center:

| Feature | With Metadata Center | Without Metadata Center |
| - | - | - |
| Architecture Features | Dedicated metadata server or center for unified metadata management | Metadata distributed among storage nodes, no dedicated metadata server |
| Metadata Management | Efficient centralized management, fast query and update speed | Distributed metadata storage, avoiding single-point bottlenecks |
| Single Point of Failure | Metadata server may become a single point of failure, requiring additional high availability design | No single-node failure risk |
| Deployment Complexity | Complex deployment and maintenance, requiring professional operation skills | Relatively simple deployment and maintenance, suitable for cloud-native and containerized scenarios |
| Performance Issues | In high concurrency environments, metadata server may become a performance bottleneck | Small file support consumes more IOPS |
| Typical Scenarios | File systems (like Lustre, CephFS) and scenarios requiring complex metadata | Object storage (RustFS, MinIO) and large-scale distributed systems |

## About Storage Speed

RustFS adopts the same design as MinIO, with overall speed depending on the network and disk speed of storage nodes. Through evaluation, RustFS can achieve read speeds of 323 GB/s and write speeds of 183 GB/s.

It can be said that RustFS and MinIO are the only two leading distributed object storage products in the world in terms of speed. Under the same configuration, their speed is much faster than Ceph.
