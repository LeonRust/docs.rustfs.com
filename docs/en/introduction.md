# What is RustFS?

RustFS is a simple, efficient, distributed object storage solution.
It is also an efficient, open-source, and free object storage solution. It is 100% compatible with the S3 protocol and is open-source software released under the Apache2 license. RustFS is written in Rust, currently the world's most popular memory-safe language.
It is a commercial-friendly distributed object storage product contributed by excellent engineers worldwide. RustFS can replace many object storage products with unfriendly open-source licenses.

RustFS is about to transition from commercial applications to open source, releasing globally to help the world reduce storage costs and improve data security.
